# Controller_Demo_XNA

This is a demo made with C# showcasing the ability to debug and interact with controller input with XNA.
Made as part of an assignment I had in third year.

### Controls
All controls are based on the Xbox 360. Drivers for windows are [here](https://www.microsoft.com/accessories/en-ie/d/xbox-360-controller-for-windows "Xbox 360 Controller Drivers") if not already installed
A PS3 contoller can also be used on Windows if you install [ScpToolKit](https://github.com/nefarius/ScpToolkit "Windows Driver and XInput Wrapper for Sony DualShock 3/4 Controllers")

### Executable
To run the executable you must install the [XNA Redistributable](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ie/download/details.aspx?id=27598 "Microsoft XNA Framework Redistributable 4.0 Refresh")

### Platform
This was built for all Windows platforms that support XNA.
